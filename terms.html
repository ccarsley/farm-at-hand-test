The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you. We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion.

<h3>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h3>

<p class="blockquote">THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY SASKATCHEWAN LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Farm At Hand with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Farm At Hand's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
